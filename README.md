# webnews-test

Included in this repo are all frontend files for the Webnews test.

Live version of test can be seen here: http://webnews.milljosoftware.com/

Important Points:
- Site is fully responsive based on my understanding on how it should look
- As per task requirements, absolutely no content was inserted into content boxes. Styles were added to show positioning using flexbox and responsive site design
- Considering that the left menu and header menu could possibily be repeated on serveral pages, and also to help code readability, I designed them as AngularJS components
- As per task requirements, no elements have any kind of functional behaviour
